Statistical learning refers to describe the ability to detect and use statistical structure. The capacity is not just a feature of human intelligence; it is ubiquitous and effective across lifespans, domains, sensory modalities and levels of consciousness. By examining the course of learning of word-referent pairs across time, I evaluate two competing models – the multiple hypotheses and propose-yet-verify models – of one variant of the process, as well as the possibility that neither sufficiently explain how statistical learning is carried out.
